Urban cities have significantly more drivers and rides than suburban or rural cities. However, rural cities have higher fares than urban cities, which could be because of less availability in rural cities which leads to higher fares. Suburban cities have less drivers than urban cities, and the fares are lower than in rural cities. Suburban cities are in the middle, there are less people riding than in urban cities, but enough people need rides so the fares don't increase too much. Overall, the majority of uber and lyft service is in urban cities.
